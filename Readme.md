# Traders Dynamic Index
This indicator is built based on relative strength index in which the first product when processing the RSI is a Trade Line, then the average of a Trade Line is taken to produce Trade Signal & Market baseline.

### About the indicator
#### Intro
The Traders Dynamic Index (TDI) is a technical analysis indicator used by traders and investors to evaluate market conditions and predict price movements. It combines trend analysis, momentum, and volatility elements to provide a comprehensive market view. Developed by Dean Malone, the TDI is a versatile indicator that can be applied to various timeframes and market conditions.

#### Components
The TDI consists of three main components: the Price Line, the Trade Signal Line, and the Market Base Line. Each of these components plays a vital role in the overall performance and interpretation of the TDI.

### My contribution
On my end I built this so that it can be executed from the Metatrader5 in which I also added a window that shows a trade signal that is averaged.
